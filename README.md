üë§ Role Creation in PostgreSQL
```
What is a Role?
A role in PostgreSQL is a database-level identity that can represent a user, a group, or both. Roles can own objects, log in, and be granted privileges

üõ†Ô∏è Creating a Role
CREATE ROLE myuser;

This creates a role without login capability. To allow login, use:
CREATE ROLE myuser WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'securepassword';

üîê Role Attributes
------------------
Attribute      Description
---------      ---------------------------------------------------------
LOGIN          Allows the role to connect to the database
SUPERUSER      Grants all privileges (use with caution!)
CREATEDB       Allows role to create new databases
CREATEROLE     Allows role to create other roles
INHERIT        Role inherits privileges from roles it is a member of
REPLICATION    Allows replication connections
BYPASSRLS      Bypasses row-level security policies  

Example with multiple attributes:
CREATE ROLE admin WITH LOGIN CREATEDB CREATEROLE INHERIT PASSWORD 'adminpass';

-Roles can be members of other roles (like groups):
GRANT dev_team TO alice;

üîÑ Role Management Summary
--------------------------
Task                    Command
----                    -----------------------------------------------
Create role             CREATE ROLE myuser;
Allow login             CREATE ROLE myuser WITH LOGIN;
Set password            ALTER ROLE myuser WITH PASSWORD 'pass';
Grant role membership   GRANT roleA TO roleB;
Drop role               DROP ROLE myuser;

```

## Privileges
```
- When an objects are created in postgresql, It is assigned an owner. The owner is normally the role that ececuted the creation statement.
- Only owner and super user can do aything with the objects. To allow other roles to use objects. Privileges must be granted.

* Postgresql provides different kind of privileges 
    [SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,TRUNCATE,REFERANCE,USAGE,TRIGER,CREATE,CONNECT,TEMPORARY,EXECUTE]
   -These privileges are depends on objects type [table, index,sequence, functin etc..]
   - We can assign new new owner to object by using "ALTER objectname" command but this can be done by SUPERUSER and if the role is member of ownning role and current owner.

* We can Grant following three Database Level Privileges to role:-  
 -CONNECT	: Allows connection to the database
 -CREATE	: Allows creation of new schemas within the database
 -TEMPORARY : or TEMP	Allows creation of temporary tables

( GRANT CONNECT, CREATE, TEMP ON DATABASE mydb TO myuser; )

* We can Grant following 7 Tables & Views Level Privileges to role:- 
SELECT	       Read rows
INSERT	       Add rows
UPDATE	       Modify rows
DELETE	       Remove rows
TRUNCATE	     Remove all rows
REFERENCES	   Create foreign keys
TRIGGER	      Create triggers

(GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON TABLE mytable TO myuser;)

* We can Grant following 3 Seaquence Level Privileges to role:-
USAGE	    Use the sequence
SELECT	   Read current value
UPDATE	    Modify current value

(GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE myseq TO myuser;)

* We can Grant following 1 Functions & Procedures Level Privileges to role:-
EXECUTE  :	Run the function/procedure

(GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION myfunc(int) TO myuser;)

* We can grant following 2 Schemas level privileges to role:-
USAGE:	Access objects in the schema
CREATE:	Create new objects in the schema

(GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA myschema TO myuser;)

‚úÖ Types of Objects You Can Grant Privileges On

Object Type           Privileges You Can Grant                          Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Database              CONNECT, CREATE, TEMP                             Controls access to the database itself
Schema                USAGE, CREATE                                     Controls access to objects inside the schema
Table                 SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE,         Most commonly used
                      REFERENCES, TRIGGER
Sequence              USAGE, SELECT, UPDATE                             For auto-incrementing values
Function              EXECUTE                                           Needed to run stored procedures
Type                  USAGE                                             For custom data types
Foreign Data Wrapper  USAGE                                             For external data sources
Foreign Server        USAGE                                             For connecting to external servers
Large Object          SELECT, UPDATE                                    Used for binary data (less common)
Tablespace            CREATE                                            Controls where objects are stored
Column                SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, REFERENCES                Can be granted at column level too


```
## üß¨  Default Privileges
```
-These control what privileges are automatically granted on newly created objects.
-if you configure default privileges for a role, then any new table or sequence created by that role will automatically grant those privileges to the specified target role or user.

* Use ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES to set them:
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA myschema
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON TABLES TO myuser;

* You can set defaults for:
Tables
Sequences
Functions
Types
Schemas
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Granting All Privileges
```
If you want to grant all possible privileges, use:
üîπ On a database:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydb TO myuser;
üîπ On a table:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE mytable TO myuser;
üîπ On a schema:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA myschema TO myuser;

üßπ Bonus: Revoking Privileges
To remove access:
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydb FROM 

```

User Privileges :-
```
User management in PostgreSQL involves creating, granting, revoking, and dropping users/roles. Below is a detailed answer for your questions related to user privilege management and error handling.
‚úÖ 1. What are the privileges we can give to users on all levels?
üîπ Levels & Privileges:
LevelPrivilegesDescriptionServer LevelLOGIN, CREATEDB, CREATEROLE, SUPERUSER, REPLICATION, BYPASSRLSAssigned during role/user creationDatabase LevelCONNECT, TEMP, CREATEAllow connect, create temp tables, create schemasSchema LevelUSAGE, CREATEUsage = access objects; Create = create objectsTable LevelSELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, REFERENCES, TRIGGERObject-level DML permissionsSequence LevelUSAGE, SELECT, UPDATEControl on nextval, currval, setvalFunction LevelEXECUTEPermission to run the functionColumn LevelSELECT, INSERT, UPDATEFine-grained table column permissions
‚úÖ 2. How to grant privileges to users? (All Ways)

üîπ Function Level
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION func1() TO user1;
‚úÖ 3. How to revoke privileges (All levels & all ways)?

üîπ Sequence
REVOKE USAGE, SELECT, UPDATE ON SEQUENCE seq1 FROM user1;
üîπ Default Privileges
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public REVOKE SELECT ON TABLES FROM user1;
‚úÖ 4. What are the common errors while revoking privileges?
Error MessageCauseExampleWARNING: no privileges could be revokedUser doesn't have the privileges you're trying to revokeAlready revoked or never grantedERROR: permission deniedYou are not the owner of object or not superuserRevoking from another user‚Äôs tableERROR: column "xyz" does not existMistyped column nameRevoke on wrong columnERROR: must be owner of relation/tableYou tried revoking on a table you don‚Äôt ownNon-owner revoke attempt
‚úÖ 5. GRANT USER, CREATE USER, DROP USER
üîπ CREATE USER / ROLE
CREATE USER user1 WITH PASSWORD 'pass';
-- OR
CREATE ROLE user1 LOGIN PASSWORD 'pass';
üîπ GRANT ROLE Privileges
GRANT SELECT ON emp TO user1;
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE db1 TO user1;
üîπ DROP USER
DROP USER user1;
-- OR
DROP ROLE user1;
‚ö†Ô∏è Errors While Dropping User:
ErrorCauseFixERROR: role "user1" cannot be dropped because some objects depend on itUser owns objects (tables, schemas)Reassign ownership or drop objectsERROR: role "user1" is a member of role "xyz"Role assigned to other rolesREVOKE xyz FROM user1;ERROR: role "user1" does not existMistyped or already droppedVerify with \du or query pg_roles

Extensions

```
# üîß pg_repack

What it does: Reorganizes tables and indexes to remove bloat without requiring heavy locks.

Why use it: Alternative to VACUUM FULL, but works online with minimal disruption.

How it works: Creates a new table, copies data, applies changes via a log table, then swaps.

Create:
CREATE EXTENSION pg_repack;

Precheck:
Table must have a primary key or UNIQUE NOT NULL index.
Ensure enough free disk space (2x the size of table + indexes).

Postcheck:
Monitor logs and verify table size reduction.
Use pgstattuple to confirm bloat removal.
```
```
üß† plpgsql
What it does: Enables procedural programming in PostgreSQL (loops, conditions, variables).
Why use it: Needed for writing stored procedures, triggers, and complex functions.
How it works: SQL is embedded in procedural blocks using BEGIN...END.
----
Create
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS plpgsql;
----
(Usually preloaded by default)
Precheck/Postcheck: Not applicable‚Äîit's a core language.
Supported versions: All PostgreSQL versions (enabled by default)
```
```
üìä pg_stat_statements

What it does: Tracks execution statistics of SQL statements.
Why use it: Helps identify slow queries and optimize performance.
How it works: Collects metrics like execution time, rows returned, and block hits.
----
Create: Add to postgresql.conf:
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
Then restart and run:
CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;

----
Precheck:
Must be added to shared_preload_libraries.
Requires server restart.

Postcheck:
Query pg_stat_statements view to analyze performance.

```
```
‚è±Ô∏è pg_cron

What it does: Schedules SQL jobs using cron syntax inside PostgreSQL.
Why use it: Automates maintenance, reporting, and recurring tasks.
How it works: Background worker executes scheduled SQL commands.
Create: Add to postgresql.conf:
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_cron'
CREATE EXTENSION pg_cron;

Precheck:
Requires shared_preload_libraries.
Must be installed in only one database per cluster.

Postcheck:
Monitor cron.job and cron.job_run_details tables.
```

```
ü§ñ azure_ai
What it does: Connects PostgreSQL to Azure Cognitive Services for AI/ML inference.

Why use it: Enables real-time predictions and analysis directly from SQL.

How it works: Uses REST APIs to send data to Azure AI and return results.

Create:
CREATE EXTENSION azure_ai;

Precheck:
Must be allowlisted in Azure Flexible Server.
Requires Azure credentials and endpoint setup.

Postcheck:
Validate inference results and monitor latency.
```

```
üßπ pg_squeeze

What it does: Automatically removes table bloat using background workers.

Why use it: Like pg_repack, but more efficient and less intrusive.

How it works: Uses logical decoding to rebuild tables with minimal locking.

Create: Add to postgresql.conf:
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_squeeze'
wal_level = logical
max_replication_slots = 1

Then restart and run:
CREATE EXTENSION pg_squeeze;

Precheck:
Table must have a primary key or identity index.
Register table in squeeze.tables:
INSERT INTO squeeze.tables (tabschema, tabname, schedule) VALUES ('public', 'my_table', ...);

Postcheck:
Monitor squeeze logs and verify table size reduction.
```

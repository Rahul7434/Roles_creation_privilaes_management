## Privileges
```
- When an objects are created in postgresql, It is assigned an owner. The owner is normally the role that ececuted the creation statement.
- Only owner and super user can do aything with the objects. To allow other roles to use objects. Privileges must be granted.

* Postgresql provides different kind of privileges 
    [SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,TRUNCATE,REFERANCE,USAGE,TRIGER,CREATE,CONNECT,TEMPORARY,EXECUTE]
   -These privileges are depends on objects type [table, index,sequence, functin etc..]
   - We can assign new new owner to object by using "ALTER objectname" command but this can be done by SUPERUSER and if the role is member of ownning role and current owner.

* We can Grant following three Database Level Privileges to role:-  
 -CONNECT	: Allows connection to the database
 -CREATE	: Allows creation of new schemas within the database
 -TEMPORARY : or TEMP	Allows creation of temporary tables

( GRANT CONNECT, CREATE, TEMP ON DATABASE mydb TO myuser; )

* We can Grant following 7 Tables & Views Level Privileges to role:- 
SELECT	       Read rows
INSERT	       Add rows
UPDATE	       Modify rows
DELETE	       Remove rows
TRUNCATE	     Remove all rows
REFERENCES	   Create foreign keys
TRIGGER	      Create triggers

(GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON TABLE mytable TO myuser;)

* We can Grant following 3 Seaquence Level Privileges to role:-
USAGE	    Use the sequence
SELECT	   Read current value
UPDATE	    Modify current value

(GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON SEQUENCE myseq TO myuser;)

* We can Grant following 1 Functions & Procedures Level Privileges to role:-
EXECUTE  :	Run the function/procedure

(GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION myfunc(int) TO myuser;)

* We can grant following 2 Schemas level privileges to role:-
USAGE:	Access objects in the schema
CREATE:	Create new objects in the schema

(GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA myschema TO myuser;)

```
## üß¨  Default Privileges
```
-These control what privileges are automatically granted on newly created objects.
-if you configure default privileges for a role, then any new table or sequence created by that role will automatically grant those privileges to the specified target role or user.

* Use ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES to set them:
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA myschema
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON TABLES TO myuser;

* You can set defaults for:
Tables
Sequences
Functions
Types
Schemas
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Granting All Privileges
```
If you want to grant all possible privileges, use:
üîπ On a database:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydb TO myuser;
üîπ On a table:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE mytable TO myuser;
üîπ On a schema:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA myschema TO myuser;

üßπ Bonus: Revoking Privileges
To remove access:
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydb FROM
